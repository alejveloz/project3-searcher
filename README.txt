Notes:

Changes to Project 3 Part A:
[Insert changes which were made after initial submission]
[Check git to remember these, mostly related to lucene library]

Changed type of Item ID in indexer from 'float' to 'int'
Float was causing issues which we noticed after basic search examples were 
 coming up substantially under expected counts.
